# Hi there, I'm Besim!  
**Welcome,** [your visitor number is:](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=BsmYksln&color=007BFF)

I am a PhD student in Earthquake Engineering at IUSS Pavia (ROSE). My research focuses on **multi-objective optimisation of seismic retrofitting of existing buildings**.

You are here most probably for **CAD2Sees**; if not, let me introduce you:

### CAD2Sees
CAD2Sees is a Python-based tool for automated generation and analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) building models in OpenSeesPy from CAD files. The tool parses building geometry and properties from two DXF files and one JSON file, automatically creating an OpenSeesPy model suitable for seismic assessment studies.
